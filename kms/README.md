## KMS Cloudformation Template

### Concepts | [doc](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html)

#### Key Types

##### Customer managed key

- The KMS keys that you create are customer managed keys. 
- Customer managed keys are KMS keys in your AWS account that you create, own, and manage.

 
##### AWS managed key 

- AWS managed keys are KMS keys in your account that are created, managed, and used on your behalf by an AWS service integrated with AWS KMS.
- You don't have to create or maintain the key or its key policy, and there's never a monthly fee for an AWS managed key.
- you cannot change any properties of AWS managed keys, rotate them, change their key policies, or schedule them for deletion. 
- you cannot use AWS managed keys in cryptographic operations directly; the service that creates them uses them on your behalf. 
- Alias aws/service-name
 
##### AWS owned key

- AWS owned keys are a collection of KMS keys that an AWS service owns and manages for use in multiple AWS accounts. 
- Although AWS owned keys are not in your AWS account, an AWS service can use an AWS owned key to protect the resources in your account.
- AWS owned keys are completely free of charge (no monthly fees or usage fees), they do not count against the AWS KMS quotas for your account, and they're easy to use.

### Authentication and access control for AWS KMS

- No AWS principal has any permissions to a KMS key unless that permission is provided explicitly and never denied. 
- There are no implicit or automatic permission to use or manage a KMS key. 

- The primary way to manage access to your AWS KMS resources is with policies. 

-  AWS KMS resource policies for KMS keys are called key policies. All KMS keys have a key policy.

- KMS keys belong to the AWS account in which they were created. However, no identity or principal, including the AWS account root user, 
  has permission to use or manage a KMS key unless that permission is explicitly provided in a key policy, IAM policy or grant. 

- The IAM identity who creates a KMS key is not considered to be the key owner and they don't automatically have permission to use or manage the KMS key that they created. 
  Like any other identity, the key creator needs to get permission through a key policy, IAM policy, or grant.

- However, identities who have the kms:CreateKey permission can set the initial key policy and give themselves permission to use or manage the key.

- An AWS KMS key policy is a resource-based policy that controls access to a KMS key. Every KMS key must have a key policy. 

- You can use other authorization mechanism to allow access to the KMS key, but only if the key policy allows it. 
  (You can use an IAM policy to deny access to a KMS key even if the key policy doesn't explicitly permit it.)

- key policies are Regional. A key policy controls access only to a KMS key in the same Region. It has no effect on KMS keys in other Regions.

####  Key policy

â€“ Every KMS key has a key policy. It is the primary mechanism for controlling access to a KMS key. 
You can use the key policy alone to control access, which means the full scope of access to the KMS key is defined in a single document (the key policy).

##### Default key policy when you create a KMS key programmatically

- This default key policy has one policy statement that gives the AWS account that owns the KMS key permission to use IAM policies to allow access to all AWS KMS operations on the KMS key.

```
{
  "Sid": "Enable IAM User Permissions",
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Principal": {
    "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:root"
   },
  "Action": "kms:*",
  "Resource": "*"
}
```

##### Default key policy when you create a KMS key with the AWS Management Console

- When you create a KMS key with the AWS Management Console, the key policy begins with the policy statement that allows access to the AWS account and enables IAM policies. 
The console then adds a key administrators statement, a key users statement, and (for most key types) a statement that allows principals to use the KMS key with other AWS services. 

- Unlike other AWS resource policies, an AWS KMS key policy does not automatically give permission to the account or any of its identities. To give permission to account administrators, the key policy must include an explicit statement that provides this permission, like this one.

- It allows the account to use IAM policies to allow access to the KMS key, in addition to the key policy.
Without this permission, IAM policies that allow access to the key are ineffective, although IAM policies that deny access to the key are still effective.

- It reduces the risk of the key becoming unmanageable by giving access control permission to the account administrators, including the account root user, which cannot be deleted. 

##### Kms Actions [link](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-policy-default.html)

- kms:Create* Allows kms:CreateAlias and kms:CreateGrant. (The kms:CreateKey permission is valid only in an IAM policy.)

- kms:Describe* Allows kms:DescribeKey. The kms:DescribeKey permission is required to view the key details page for a KMS key in the AWS Management Console.

- kms:Enable* Allows kms:EnableKey. For symmetric encryption KMS keys, it also allows kms:EnableKeyRotation.

- kms:List* Allows kms:ListGrants, kms:ListKeyPolicies, and kms:ListResourceTags. (The kms:ListAliases and kms:ListKeys permissions, which are required to view KMS keys in the AWS Management Console, are valid only in IAM policies.)


##### Key Policy to Administer Key

- Key administrators have permissions to manage the KMS key, but do not have permissions to use the KMS key in cryptographic operations. 

- Because key administrators have permission to change the key policy and create grants, they can give themselves and others AWS KMS permissions not specified in this policy.

- IAM best practices discourage the use of IAM users with long-term credentials. Whenever possible, use IAM roles, which provide temporary credentials.

##### Key Policy to Use the Key | [global-condition-keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_condition-keys.html#AvailableKeys) | [kms-condition-leys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/conditions-kms.html)

- Gives key users permission to use the KMS key directly for all supported cryptographic operations for that type of KMS key.

- Gives key users permission to allow AWS services that are integrated with AWS KMS to use the KMS key on their behalf to protect resources, such as Amazon S3 buckets and Amazon DynamoDB tables.

- The kms:GrantIsForAWSResource policy condition doesn't allow the user to call these grant operations directly. When the key user allows it, an AWS service can create a grant on the user's behalf that allows the service to use the KMS key to protect the user's data.

- The default key policy allows key users to delegate their grant permission to all integrated services that use grants. However, you can create a custom key policy that restricts the permission to specified AWS services. For more information, see the kms:ViaService condition key.

##### KMS Policy - Autoscaling - Encryped EBS | [link](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/key-policy-requirements-EBS-encryption.html#policy-example-cmk-cross-account-access)

- Set up the key policy that you need to launch Auto Scaling instances when you specify a customer managed key for Amazon EBS encryption.

- Give the service-linked role named AWSServiceRoleForAutoScaling permissions to use the customer managed key.


```
{
   "Sid": "Allow service-linked role use of the customer managed key",
   "Effect": "Allow",
   "Principal": {
       "AWS": [
           "arn:aws:iam::account-id:role/aws-service-role/autoscaling.amazonaws.com/AWSServiceRoleForAutoScaling"
       ]
   },
   "Action": [
       "kms:Encrypt",
       "kms:Decrypt",
       "kms:ReEncrypt*",
       "kms:GenerateDataKey*",
       "kms:DescribeKey"
   ],
   "Resource": "*"
}
```

```
{
   "Sid": "Allow attachment of persistent resources",
   "Effect": "Allow",
   "Principal": {
       "AWS": [
           "arn:aws:iam::account-id:role/aws-service-role/autoscaling.amazonaws.com/AWSServiceRoleForAutoScaling"
       ]
   },
   "Action": [
       "kms:CreateGrant"
   ],
   "Resource": "*",
   "Condition": {
       "Bool": {
           "kms:GrantIsForAWSResource": true
       }
    }
}
```

- Customer managed key in a different account than the Auto Scaling group, you must use a grant in combination with the key policy to allow cross-account access to the key.

```
{
   "Sid": "Allow external account 111122223333 use of the customer managed key",
   "Effect": "Allow",
   "Principal": {
       "AWS": [
           "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:root"
       ]
   },
   "Action": [
       "kms:Encrypt",
       "kms:Decrypt",
       "kms:ReEncrypt*",
       "kms:GenerateDataKey*",
       "kms:DescribeKey"
   ],
   "Resource": "*"
}
```
```
{
   "Sid": "Allow attachment of persistent resources in external account 111122223333",
   "Effect": "Allow",
   "Principal": {
       "AWS": [
           "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:root"
       ]
   },
   "Action": [
       "kms:CreateGrant"
   ],
   "Resource": "*"
}
```

- From the account that you want to create the Auto Scaling group in, create a grant that delegates the relevant permissions to the appropriate service-linked role. 

```
aws kms create-grant \
  --region us-west-2 \
  --key-id arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:444455556666:key/1a2b3c4d-5e6f-1a2b-3c4d-5e6f1a2b3c4d \
  --grantee-principal arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/aws-service-role/autoscaling.amazonaws.com/AWSServiceRoleForAutoScaling \
  --operations "Encrypt" "Decrypt" "ReEncryptFrom" "ReEncryptTo" "GenerateDataKey" "GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext" "DescribeKey" "CreateGrant"
```

- User making the request must have permissions for the CreateGrant action.

```
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "AllowCreationOfGrantForTheKMSKeyinExternalAccount444455556666",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "kms:CreateGrant",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:444455556666:key/1a2b3c4d-5e6f-1a2b-3c4d-5e6f1a2b3c4d"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### IAM policies 
â€“ You can use IAM policies in combination with the key policy and grants to control access to a KMS key. Controlling access this way enables you to manage all of the permissions for your IAM identities in IAM. To use an IAM policy to allow access to a KMS key, the key policy must explicitly allow it. 


#### Grants 
â€“ You can use grants in combination with the key policy and IAM policies to allow access to a KMS key. Controlling access this way enables you to allow access to the KMS key in the key policy, and to allow identities to delegate their access to others.

### Automatic Key Rotation

- Automatic rotation is optional for customer managed KMS keys.

- When you enable automatic key rotation for a KMS key, AWS KMS generates new cryptographic material for the KMS key every year. 

- AWS KMS supports automatic key rotation only for symmetric encryption KMS keys with key material that AWS KMS creates. 

- AWS KMS always rotates the key material for AWS managed KMS keys every year.

- Rotation of AWS owned KMS keys varies.

- When you use a rotated KMS key to encrypt data, AWS KMS uses the current key material.

- When you use the rotated KMS key to decrypt ciphertext, AWS KMS uses the same version of the key material that was used to encrypt it. You cannot request a particular version of the key material.

- AWS KMS rotates key material one year (approximately 365 days) after rotation is enabled, and then every year (approximately 365 days) thereafter.

#### Customer managed keys

- Because automatic key rotation is optional on customer managed keys and can be enabled and disabled at any time, the rotation date depends on the date that rotation was most recently enabled. 

#### AWS managed keys

- AWS KMS automatically rotates AWS managed keys every year (approximately 365 days). You cannot enable or disable key rotation for AWS managed keys.

- In May 2022, AWS KMS changed the rotation schedule for AWS managed keys from every three years (approximately 1,095 days) to every year (approximately 365 days).

#### AWS owned keys

- You cannot enable or disable key rotation for AWS owned keys. The key rotation strategy for an AWS owned key is determined by the AWS service that creates and manages the key. 

### Manual Key Rotation

When you rotate KMS keys manually, you also need to update references to the KMS key ID or key ARN in your applications. Aliases, which associate a friendly name with a KMS key, can make this process easier. Use an alias to refer to a KMS key in your applications. Then, when you want to change the KMS key that the application uses, instead of editing your application code, change the target KMS key of the alias.

### Key Material and Import 

##### Overview

- create a KMS key without key material and then import your own key material into that KMS key, a feature often known as "bring your own key" (BYOK).

- AWS KMS does not support decrypting any AWS KMS ciphertext outside of AWS KMS, even if the ciphertext was encrypted under a KMS key with imported key material.

##### Considerations | [link](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/importing-keys-conceptual.html#importing-keys-considerations)

- Key Deletion
    - You can delete imported key material from a KMS key, immediately rendering the KMS key unusable.
    - You can determine whether the key expires and set its expiration time. When the expiration time arrives, AWS KMS deletes the key material. 
    - Without key material, the KMS key cannot be used in any cryptographic operation. To restore the key, you must reimport the same key material into the key.

- Cannot Change Key Material
    - You can reimport the same key material, but you cannot import different key material into that KMS key.
    - You cannot enable automatic key rotation for a KMS key with imported key material. 
    - You can manually rotate a KMS key with imported key material.

- Cannot change the key material origin
    - Key material have an origin value of EXTERNAL that cannot be changed.
    - Cannot convert a KMS key with AWS KMS key material into one designed for imported key material. vice versa

- Cannot export key material
    - Cannot export any key material that you imported.
    - Maintain a copy of the key material outside of AWS, preferably in a key manager, such as a hardware security module (HSM), 
      so you can re-import the key material if you delete it or it expires.
      
- Can create multi-Region keys with imported key material
    - you must import the same key material into the primary KMS key and into each replica key. [link](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/multi-region-keys-import.html)
    
    
- Asymmetric keys and HMAC keys are portable and interoperable
    - HMAC keys â€” You can verify a HMAC tag that was generated by the HMAC KMS key with imported key material. 
    - Asymmetric encryption keys â€” You can use your private asymmetric encryption key outside of AWS to decrypt a ciphertext encrypted by the KMS key with the corresponding public key. 
    - Asymmetric signing keys â€” You can use your asymmetric signing KMS key with imported key material to verify digital signatures generated by your private signing key outside of AWS. 
    
- Symmetric encryption keys are not portable or interoperable
    - AWS KMS cannot decrypt symmetric ciphertexts that you encrypt outside of AWS, even if you use key material that you have imported.

- You're responsible for availability and durability
    - AWS KMS does not maintain the durability of imported key material at the same level as key material that AWS KMS generates.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

### KMS - Symmetric

Provision a Symmetric Key with Alias Name. 
Default Key Policy which permits everyone in the account.

[kms-symmetric](kms-symmetric.yaml)


### KMS - Symmetric - Import

Download wrapping public key and import token
To import key material, first select the wrapping key spec and wrapping algorithm you will use to encrypt the key material, then download the wrapping public key and import token for this AWS KMS key. [link](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/importing-keys-get-public-key-and-token.html)

Select wrapping key spec
The key spec of the wrapping public key determines the length of the keys in the RSA key pair that protects your key material during its transport to AWS KMS.
- RSA_4096 - recommended
- RSA_3072
- RSA_2048

Select wrapping algorithm
Choose the encryption algorithm that you'll use to protect ("wrap") your key material in transit to AWS KMS.

Encrypted key material and import token
Use your wrapping public key to encrypt your key material. Then, upload the wrapped key material and the import token that you downloaded. Learn more
