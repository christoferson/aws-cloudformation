# The key policy statement shown above gives the AWS account that owns the key permission to use IAM policies, 
# as well as key policies, to allow all actions (kms:*) on the KMS key. 

# The principal in this key policy statement is the account principal, which is represented by an ARN in this format: 
# arn:aws:iam::account-id:root. The account principal represents the AWS account and its administrators.

# When the principal in a key policy statement is the account principal, 
# the policy statement doesn't give any IAM principal permission to use the KMS key. 
# Instead, it allows the account to use IAM policies to delegate the permissions specified in the policy statement. 
# This default key policy statement allows the account to use IAM policies to delegate permission for all actions (kms:*) on the KMS key.

# Using account principal Reduces the risk of the KMS key becoming unmanageable.
# Suppose you create a key policy that gives only one user access to the KMS key. 
# If you then delete that user, the key becomes unmanageable and you must contact AWS Support to regain access to the KMS key.
# The key policy statement shown above gives permission to control the key to the account principal, 
# which represents the AWS account and its administrators, including the account root user. 
# The account root user is the only principal that cannot be deleted unless you delete the AWS account.
